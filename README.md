# 🕺 Mahendra Rao | 3D Humpty Dance Party

An interactive, high-performance 3D web experience built with **Three.js**. This project features a custom-rigged "Humpty Dumpty" character that follows your cursor, reacts to music, and celebrates with confetti.



## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the live site here: [3d-humpty.vercel.app](https://3d-humpty.vercel.app/)

## ✨ Features
* **Custom 3D Character:** A rigged Humpty Dumpty with fingers, toes, and a red cap.
* **Interactive Physics:** The character uses smooth "Lerp" interpolation to follow mouse and touch movements.
* **Dance Mode:** Real-time animation synchronization with ambient music.
* **Confetti System:** Dynamic particle physics triggered by user interaction.
* **Mobile Optimized:** High-performance rendering for 120Hz mobile screens (like OnePlus 12).
* **Contact Integration:** Dedicated contact form linked via Netlify/Vercel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **3D Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
* **Deployment:** Vercel / GitHub Pages
* **Fonts:** Inter (Google Fonts)

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html`: The core 3D scene and animation logic.
* `contact.html`: A clean, dedicated contact portal.
* `ambient.mp3`: The soundtrack for the dance party.

## ⚡ Local Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3d-humpty.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3d-humpty.git)
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser.
3. Click "Start the Dance" to begin the experience.

That is awesome to hear! I’m glad the optimizations fixed the lag on your OnePlus 12.

A great README is the "face" of your project on GitHub. It tells people what the project is, how it works, and showcases your skills as a developer.
